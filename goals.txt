Current Status:

I have now finished the main parsing program, Everything now runs as expected. Next Steps could be to add Logic that will also parsers
for the links to each item that is appended to the list. This more than likely will require you to parse for 'a' tags alongside the other info
Also the discord bot will need to be created and tied to the current program

Foot Locker webscraper:

Goal:

1. Check against user's price to find shoes within range
2. Check for a certain shoe type at the users price
3. Send notification via discord


Steps to goal:

*1 . Set up Venv 

* 2. Find a website to scrap
- Currently using footlocker (https://www.footlocker.com/en/category/mens/shoes.html)
- Check Robot.txt to make sure its valid

* 3. Setup user input to take in budget price or shoe type if applicable
- Input needed, Price point or type of shoe
- Shoe type may not be needed if price point is there

4. Scrape site by finding everything at the price point of everything from the shoe type

EX: Give results by showing all shoes at a certain price
EX: Show results for all Jordan 4's

5. Connect the finished scraper to discord to send notifications
- Users will see results within a server that can be joined by anyone


Future Goals:

- Setup multiple scrapers to run for different things (Female shoes, Shoes size etc.)
- Setup up a system to allow the program to run based on a server vote

EX: Users within server will vote for a shoe each week which will be seen and ran by the program to gather the results to send in the server.


Warnings:

Figure out how many request can be done at what frequency so the IP won't get blocked
